# Authentication with NextJS and NestJS

A sample application that demonstrates how to implement authentication with asymmetric encryption using NextJS and NestJS.

Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, is a cryptographic technique that uses a pair of keys - a public key and a private key - to encrypt and decrypt data. This technique is widely used for secure communication and authentication.
